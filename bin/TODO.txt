Short term updates:
==================
- Implement material browser


Bugs:
====
- Material browser:
   - In some cases the Hlms is saved, while it is not automatically added to the material browser
- Cubemap json generates a lot of warnings in the log when depth is enabled (this is with all non-depth textures); the log message is only in Debug


Later:
=====
- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked
- Detail weight map (how to use?)


Not to be implemented:
=====================
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
