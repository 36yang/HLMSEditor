V 1.0 updates:
=============
- http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=85264&p=530357&hilit=two+sided#p530190
- Use resource.cfg per project
- Remove unused functions in .h/.cpp files in the 'sources' directory
- Texture browser:
  - Also apply any searchPattern in case the search filter was still active and a group/asset was selected
- Main menu
  - Clone material
- Forum topic: Would be possible to use the same texture sampler for different textures? I know when exporting, if all textures use the same settings in texture sampler, 
  only one will be written, but inside the edit, still need to set a diferente one for each texture.
- Use mesh with multiple UV sets


V 1.0 Bugs:
==========
- Scroll wheel not linear? Moving a mesh is too fast when the object is zoomed in a lot
- If thumb is missing and the noimage.png is displayed, the thumb is not refreshed when reloaded and added again to the material browser;
  only after a restart the thumb is refreshed (minor bug).
- Cubemap json generates a lot of warnings in the log when depth is enabled (this is with all non-depth textures); the log message is only in Debug.
- F5 (generate HLMS) does not work when the focus in on a certain dock window (eg. node editor). Must be possible independent of window focus.


Implement later (V2.0):
======================
- Bug?: Context menu node editor: Delete selected nodes when the canvas doesn't contain nodes => crash application
- Bug?: Move texture group with textures in it, sometimes crashes
- Plugin support
  - Implement isFileDialog needed => Hlms editor ask the plugin for this and sets it to the HlmsEditorPluginData (filename or directory)
  - Check whether HlmsEditorPluginData::mInOutCurrenDatablock differs between before and after calling the executeImport; when different, create
    a new node structure
- Read multiple materials from one JSON file
- Implement option Menu: Windows -> view (and select/deselect certain windows (eg texture window)
- Import meshes
- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- Also implement drag texturefile from file exporer and drop it on the node editor (dropping from file explorer is only possible on the texture browser)
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
