Short term bugs and updates:
===========================
- Implement material browser
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
- Widget to scale the mesh (scale, position, orientation)
- Detail weight map (how to use?)


Bugs:
====
- fresnel not set properly when loading json file (in pbs) => posted on forum


Later:

- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked
