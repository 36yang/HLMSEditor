V 1.0 updates:
=============
- Offset texture with mouse must move all detail- and normal layers in case of pbs and all textures of an unlit material
- Update pdf with:
  - How to import brushes
  - What is the ..\import directory used for
  - new context menus (brush, texture thumbs, presets)
  - Extra main menu item (clear memory)
- Save material with paint applied
- Export materials (in combination with paint)
- Paint tools: Cavity modulator (edge detection) for rough edges
- Paint tools: Stencil
- Paint tools: Particles
- Paint tools: Draw straight line
- Paint tools: Alternating enable/disable force (e.g. to create a stitch effect)
- Separate Brushes and Preset widgets
  - Paint brushes => tabs per categorie (follow brush dir structure; normal brush, grunge, ...)
  - Presets => tabs per categorie (follow preset dir structure; metal, stone, ...)
- Tooltips over icons (DONE partly)
- Use projective texture as paint brush instead of simple cross mousepointer
- Use resource.cfg per project
- Remove unused functions in .h/.cpp files in the 'sources' directory
- Texture browser:
  - Also apply any searchPattern in case the search filter was still active and a group/asset was selected
- Main menu
  - Clone material
- Forum topic: Would be possible to use the same texture sampler for different textures? I know when exporting, if all textures use the same settings in texture sampler, 
  only one will be written, but inside the edit, still need to set a diferent one for each texture. => this needs sampler presets (in addition to material presets)
- Use mesh with multiple UV sets
- Different method to calculate mouse position to uv. There is still an issue beteen render to texture and render to screen.


V 1.0 Bugs:
==========
- Load a Pbs material, paint on the diffuse texture, save the material (updated texture is also save). Then create a new paintlayer
  an paint again on the texture layer. Painting is still done (see textures in the /temp directory). The TextureLayer::blitTexture
  doesn't work anymore. When loading the material from file again, the texture is updated (but still not possible to paint).
- Faster loading of textures in texture browser (problem with importing dirs with a lot of texture files)
- Resetting position and orientation of the camera/mesh in the renderwindow requires two mouse clicks on the same marker button
- Scroll wheel not linear? Moving a mesh is too fast when the object is zoomed in a lot
- If thumb is missing and the noimage.png is displayed, the thumb is not refreshed when reloaded and added again to the material browser;
  only after a restart the thumb is refreshed (minor bug).
- Cubemap json generates a lot of warnings in the log when depth is enabled (this is with all non-depth textures); the log message is only in Debug.
- F5 (generate HLMS) does not work when the focus in on a certain dock window (eg. node editor). Must be possible independent of window focus.


Implement later (V2.0):
======================
- Bug?: Context menu node editor: Delete selected nodes when the canvas doesn't contain nodes => crash application
- Bug?: Move texture group with textures in it, sometimes crashes
- Plugin support
  - Implement isFileDialog needed => Hlms editor ask the plugin for this and sets it to the HlmsEditorPluginData (filename or directory)
  - Check whether HlmsEditorPluginData::mInOutCurrenDatablock differs between before and after calling the executeImport; when different, create
    a new node structure
- Read multiple materials from one JSON file
- Implement option Menu: Windows -> view (and select/deselect certain windows (eg texture window)
- Import meshes
- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- Also implement drag texturefile from file exporer and drop it on the node editor (dropping from file explorer is only possible on the texture browser)
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
