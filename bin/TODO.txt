V 1.0 updates:
=============
- Rotate in all directions
- Save material with paint applied
- Export materials (in combination with paint)
- Paint tools: Smudge tool
- Paint tools: Cavity modulator (edge detection) for rough edges
- Paint brushes => tabs per categorie (follow brush dir structure; normal brush, ...)
- Tooltips over icons (DONE partly)
- Move texture over the mesh (apply offset by means of the mouse)
- Offset samplerblock -> by means of slider
- Scale samplerblock -> by means of slider
- Use projective texture as paint brush instead of simple cross mousepointer
- Use resource.cfg per project
- Remove unused functions in .h/.cpp files in the 'sources' directory
- Texture browser:
  - Also apply any searchPattern in case the search filter was still active and a group/asset was selected
- Main menu
  - Clone material
- Forum topic: Would be possible to use the same texture sampler for different textures? I know when exporting, if all textures use the same settings in texture sampler, 
  only one will be written, but inside the edit, still need to set a diferente one for each texture.
- Use mesh with multiple UV sets


V 1.0 Bugs:
==========
- Select and apply Pbs material to mesh. Select detail normal map and move the texture (texture offset). Change the offset settings by means of the property editor and move the texture
  again with the mouse -> crash (no log message).
- Faster loading of textures in texture browser (problem with importing dirs with a lot of texture files)
- Resetting position and orientation of the camera/mesh in the renderwindow requires two mouse clicks on the same marker button
- Scroll wheel not linear? Moving a mesh is too fast when the object is zoomed in a lot
- If thumb is missing and the noimage.png is displayed, the thumb is not refreshed when reloaded and added again to the material browser;
  only after a restart the thumb is refreshed (minor bug).
- Cubemap json generates a lot of warnings in the log when depth is enabled (this is with all non-depth textures); the log message is only in Debug.
- F5 (generate HLMS) does not work when the focus in on a certain dock window (eg. node editor). Must be possible independent of window focus.


Implement later (V2.0):
======================
- Bug?: Context menu node editor: Delete selected nodes when the canvas doesn't contain nodes => crash application
- Bug?: Move texture group with textures in it, sometimes crashes
- Plugin support
  - Implement isFileDialog needed => Hlms editor ask the plugin for this and sets it to the HlmsEditorPluginData (filename or directory)
  - Check whether HlmsEditorPluginData::mInOutCurrenDatablock differs between before and after calling the executeImport; when different, create
    a new node structure
- Read multiple materials from one JSON file
- Implement option Menu: Windows -> view (and select/deselect certain windows (eg texture window)
- Import meshes
- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- Also implement drag texturefile from file exporer and drop it on the node editor (dropping from file explorer is only possible on the texture browser)
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
