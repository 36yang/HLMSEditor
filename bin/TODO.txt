V 1.0 updates:
=============
- Material browser:
  - Write/read resourceType as 4th element in the materials.cfg (and not as last)
- Align the dock widgets (so they are displayed with the correct height and width after start)
- Set output directory for generated shader files
- Remove unused functions in .h/.cpp files in the 'sources' directory
- Create windows installer
- Texture browser:
  - Also apply any searchPattern in case the search filter was still active and a group/asset was selected
  - Save settings
  - Implement doubleclick in texture browser
  - Check on existing texturefile (if not existing, ask to delete it from the texture browser. Similar to the material browser)

V 1.0 Bugs:
==========
- Material browser:
  - If thumb is missing and the noimage.png is displayed, the thumb is not refreshed when reloaded and added again to the material browser;
    only after a restart the thumb is refreshed (minor bug).
- Cubemap json generates a lot of warnings in the log when depth is enabled (this is with all non-depth textures); the log message is only in Debug.
- F5 (generate HLMS) does not work when the focus in on a certain dock window (eg. node editor). Must be possible independent of window focus.

Implement later (V2.0):
======================
- Read multiple materials from one JSON file
- Implement option Menu: Windows -> view (and select/deselect certain windows (eg texture window)
- Export/Import function: Make it possible to load import/export plugins (for custom formats)
- Import meshes
- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- Also implement drag texturefile from file exporer and drop it on the node editor (dropping from file explorer is only possible on the texture browser)
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked

Not to be implemented:
=====================
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
