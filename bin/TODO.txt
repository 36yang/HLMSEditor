V 1.0 updates:
=============
- Apply material per submesh. Approach:
  1. Apply a material with a unique colour to each submesh
  2. Render the renderwindow to a texture
  3. Map the mouse coordinates in the renderwindow to the rendertexture and read the colour of the underlying rendertexture
  4. Determine the pixel colour under the mousecursor and determine to which submesh this belongs
  5. Re-apply the original materials to the submeshes again
  6. Apply the material to this submesh or highlight the submesh first
- Use resource.cfg per project
- Align the dock widgets (so they are displayed with the correct height and width after start)
- Remove unused functions in .h/.cpp files in the 'sources' directory
- Texture browser:
  - Also apply any searchPattern in case the search filter was still active and a group/asset was selected
- Main menu
  - Clone material
- Forum topic: Would be possible to use the same texture sampler for different textures? I know when exporting, if all textures use the same settings in texture sampler, 
  only one will be written, but inside the edit, still need to set a diferente one for each texture.
- Forum topic: Another request, would be possible to rotate the directional light inside the render viewport?
- Use mesh with multiple UV sets


V 1.0 Bugs:
==========
- hlms_unlit_builder.cpp => Change as result in Ogre commit 21b9540: texLocation.xIdx = datablock->_getTextureIdx( textureType );
- Material browser:
  - If thumb is missing and the noimage.png is displayed, the thumb is not refreshed when reloaded and added again to the material browser;
    only after a restart the thumb is refreshed (minor bug).
- Cubemap json generates a lot of warnings in the log when depth is enabled (this is with all non-depth textures); the log message is only in Debug.
- F5 (generate HLMS) does not work when the focus in on a certain dock window (eg. node editor). Must be possible independent of window focus.


Implement later (V2.0):
======================
- Bug?: Context menu node editor: Delete selected nodes when the canvas doesn't contain nodes => crash application
- Bug?: Move texture group with textures in it, sometimes crashes
- Plugin support
  - Implement isFileDialog needed => Hlms editor ask the plugin for this and sets it to the HlmsEditorPluginData (filename or directory)
  - Check whether HlmsEditorPluginData::mInOutCurrenDatablock differs between before and after calling the executeImport; when different, create
    a new node structure
- Read multiple materials from one JSON file
- Implement option Menu: Windows -> view (and select/deselect certain windows (eg texture window)
- Import meshes
- Combine multiple json files / datablocks into 1 and take care of duplicate macroblocks and blendblocks
- Also implement drag texturefile from file exporer and drop it on the node editor (dropping from file explorer is only possible on the texture browser)
- asset_propertywidget_color.h => does not take current colour into account
- QtAssetWidget signal when an action icon on the property is clicked
- Listbox after loading a json file, so it is possible to select a datablock
